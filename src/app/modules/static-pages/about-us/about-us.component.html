        </h3>
        <p class="text-justify">CoFynd was born when Atul realised a paradigm shift in the way people wanted to Work &
          Live. Many were
          leaving behind the traditional mundane offices to quirky Co-Working spaces and conventional living to
          community based Co-Living. With a solid vision in his mind, he implemented this platform with the technology
          partner in the country, T9L to fulfill the dynamic user needs.</p>
