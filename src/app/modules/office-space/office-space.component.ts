  footer_description = `<p>For commercial office spaces, India is a ready to go destination for startups, SMEs and Fortune 500 companies. Office space is a space that is completely split apart from other companies. In comparison to other spaces, these offer more control, solitude to its members and peaceful working surroundings.</p>

  <p>Commercial Office spaces in India provides abundant advantages to its members like-&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p><strong>Privacy:</strong> An office space provides the much needed privacy for crucial company related discussions and work.&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p><strong>Concentration: </strong>There is an absence of disturbance in an office space. Hence, there is a possibility of increased concentration for work also which helps to increase the efficiency of the members.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><strong>Low overhead costs: </strong>Office space lessens costs with access to all the basic amenities required for business efficiency. With the availability of free equipment, there is more space to expand and employee motivation to shoot up.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Frequent cleaning: </strong>A commercial office space is tidier and less crowded. Congestion is usually eliminated in these spaces.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Loaded with amenities:</strong> Office space offers a multitude of amenities like high-speed internet, frequent sanitization, mailing services, reception staff, IT support, furnished rooms, events space, car parking, kitchen area, strict security system and more.&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p><strong>Fosters Teamwork: </strong>A real office setting can boost productivity and connection between employees, allowing overall teamwork and collaboration. &nbsp;</p>
  
  <h2><span>Types of Office Spaces in India</span></h2>
  
  <p><strong>Serviced Office:</strong> A serviced office space is a ready to move in space. It is fully furnished with provision of all amenities, so a company just needs to pack up and settle in- as easy as that!&nbsp;These spaces are suitable for larger businesses which require a flexible space to operate on.&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p><strong>Managed Offices:</strong> These spaces are also known as customisable or bespoke offices. They are an alternative to serviced office spaces with a third party looking after the operations. Additionally, they offer an all inclusive monthly fee, with much more flexibility and freedom.&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p>All in all, a managed office can be designed to specific requirements- from start to finish. They are most suitable for small scale businesses, startups, SMEs which are searching to have a customised space, without any trouble and upfront costs.&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p><strong>Leased Offices:</strong> In a leased office, a tenant has all the responsibilities of furnishing, installing their own internet connection, partition for cabins and more. The initial costs of organising the offices are hence higher than others. These spaces are taken for a period of 5 to 10 years and thus the costs reduce all throughout this time. So, they are a solution for more established businesses who want to have a control over their expenses and create office space as per their need.&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p><strong>Subleased Offices:</strong> A subleased office offers a tenant to obtain a leased office for a shorter but more flexible span of time. Members of such spaces are benefitted from the similar advantages as leased spaces but at budget-friendly prices.&nbsp;</p>
